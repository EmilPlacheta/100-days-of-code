### DAY 1:  5th May 2020, Tuesdwa

**Today's Progress**: First day, did a list of small projects I could do during the remaining 99days, that i always wanted to do but didnt have time or easnt worth the time at that moment. More edabid challanges.

**Thoughts**: Although I find challanges to be a good way to learn, small projects are the way to go. It will also bolster my portfolio, hopefully.


### DAY 0:  4th May 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Joined the challange. Forked the repo and spent the evening solving challanges on edabit.

**Thoughts**: Although im doing something code related pretty much every day, I was intrigued by the 'log' keeping aspect of the challange. It seems like a good way to track progress and will be helpful in the future to look back on what see what I found challenging in the past.
