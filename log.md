### DAY 3:  7th May 2020, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: I wanted to cleanup the mockup code from yesterday, and add a basic UI and some styling, but I noticed a bug. The calculation will only be correct if only one person spends more than the average share (total spent / 3 = fair share everyone should pay). At the momemnt calculation determines the biggest speneder, checks how much over the average (fair share) they spent and and how much others spent below the average and prints the respective diference. 
This does not work when one person spent a lot less and need to compensate the other two.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes if you think something seems easy, it might be because you didnt think longe enough about it.

### DAY 2:  6th May 2020, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Receipt splitter that showes who is owed money after a week of shopping, when 3 people did a shop and spent different amounts. It logs who should recieve money from who and how much.

**Thoughts**: I thought ill make this to better answer my girlfriends mum question from few days ago about what Im doing, and what web development can be. Had to be made quickly as I could see my girlfriends and her mums attention slipping with every passing second...



### DAY 1:  5th May 2020, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: First day, did a list of small projects I could do during the remaining 99days, that i always wanted to do but didnt have time or easnt worth the time at that moment. More edabid challanges.

**Thoughts**: Although I find challanges to be a good way to learn, small projects are the way to go. It will also bolster my portfolio, hopefully.



### DAY 0:  4th May 2020, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Joined the challange. Forked the repo and spent the evening solving challanges on edabit.

**Thoughts**: Although im doing something code related pretty much every day, I was intrigued by the 'log' keeping aspect of the challange. It seems like a good way to track progress and will be helpful in the future to look back on what see what I found challenging in the past.
