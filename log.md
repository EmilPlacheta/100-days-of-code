### DAY 0:  4th May 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Joined the challange. Forked the repo and spent the evening solving challanges on edabit.

**Thoughts**: Although im doing something code related pretty much every day, I was intrigued by the 'log' keeping aspect of the challange. It seems like a good way to track progress and will be helpful in the future to look back on what see what I found challenging in the past.
